# Poetic-Personality-Chatbot
Chatbot that transforms every user message into beautiful, poetic verses using the power of large language models (LLMs). Whether someone types, “I’m feeling happy today,” or shares a deeper sentiment, the chatbot will respond with expressive lines such as: “In fields of joy, your heart does dance, / With sunlight’s glow, your soul’s expanse.

To give my chatbot a poetic soul, i'll apply Prompt Engineering techniques to guide the Gemini model into responding with rhythm and emotion — as if the user is conversing with a thoughtful, lyrical companion. Each message will be crafted to feel personal and profound, bringing a poetic interpretation to everyday thoughts.

To make the interaction even more immersive, i’ll implement a typing animation effect, creating the impression of a live poet composing verses in real time.
